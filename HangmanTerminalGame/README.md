## Overview

This game is a hangman game played in the terminal. The program will start by selecting a hidden word randomly from the words.txt file. The game will show how many letters are in the hidden word to the player. It is up to the player to guess letters to reveal what the hidden word is. As the player correctly guesses letters, they will be filled in within the hidden word. For each wrong guess the player gives the hangman image will become more drawn in. If the player gives too many wrong guesses and the entire image is drawn, then the player loses. It is up to the player to correctly guess the word before the entire hangman image is drawn. The current hangman image will always be displayed to the screen after each guess. The game will ask the player to type their guesses on the command line.

## Compilation and Running the Game

To compile navigate to within the HangmanTerminalGame directory or whatever directory the hangman.java file is in and enter "javac hangman.java".
