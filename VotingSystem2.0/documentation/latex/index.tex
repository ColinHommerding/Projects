The Voting System is a tool that people can use to calculate and analyze results for voting.

This system will be designed to maximize productivity by automating the counting of ballots and generating an accurate result.

Users can use it to give results to the media and produce a detailed audit file that allows the user to review the development of the election.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{repo-\/\+Team14}\label{index_autotoc_md1}

\item The executable files themselves can be found at {\ttfamily ./build/src/\+Voting\+System} for the program and at\textbackslash{} {\ttfamily ./build/testing/\+Voting\+System\+\_\+test} for the Google\+Test files.
\item To run the program in debug mode, use {\ttfamily ./bin/debug.sh} from the {\ttfamily /\+Project2} directory or directly by running the executable with a {\ttfamily -\/d} flag, i.\+e. {\ttfamily ./\+Voting\+System -\/d}.

This program comes with many test input files, found in {\ttfamily testing/\{IR,OPL,PO\}\+\_\+input\+\_\+files}, which can be\textbackslash{} entered as input when prompted by the program. (UPDATE) Enter the full path from the {\ttfamily /\+Project2/} directory when\textbackslash{} entering these files, e.\+g. {\ttfamily /testing/\+IR\+\_\+input\+\_\+files/\+IR\+\_\+stress\+\_\+test.csv} to input the file {\ttfamily IR\+\_\+stress\+\_\+test.\+csv}

To run unit/system tests, ensure you are in the {\ttfamily repo-\/\+Team14/\+Project2} directory and run {\ttfamily ./bin/test.sh}

To run {\ttfamily make} and {\ttfamily make clean} commands, use {\ttfamily ./bin/make.sh} and {\ttfamily ./bin/clean.sh}, respectively
