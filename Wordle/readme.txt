Instructions to play Wordle Game

1. Now that you have the game up and running it is time to start playing. Wordle has started by selecting a random 5 letter english word that you have to try and guess.

2. Enter in a 5 letter word that you wish to guess by clicking on the letters in the on-screen keyboard. If you mistype, the delete button will remove your most recently selected letter.

3. Once you have the word type in, select enter to try your guess. Wordle will respond by highlighting the letters you selected in yellow and green. Yellow letters mean that the letter you guessed is in the answer but you have it in the wrong spot. A green letter means the letter you guessed is in the answer and in the correct spot.

4. You have 6 total guesses to guess the answer word. If you get the answer correct, all letters will be highlighted in green and the game will tell you that you won. If you go all 6 guesses without getting the word, the game will tell you that you lost and reveal what the answer word was.

5. Once the game is over, you can refresh the page to play again.
